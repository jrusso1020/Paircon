So9ware	development	staﬀ
•

Professional	staﬀ	are	the	major	cost	of	so(ware

•

Staﬀ	vary	greatly	in	producGvity:

	 =>	Ability
	 =>	EducaGon	and	training
	 =>	MoGvaGon
	 =>	InteracGon	with	colleagues	and	leaders
•

Work	environment	has	an	impact	on	producGvity

Management	ImplicaGons	of	Maslow's	Hierarchy
Physiological	needs:		
Food,	water,	breathing,	sleep
Safety	needs:		
Security	of	person,	health,	family
Social	needs:	
Friendship,	colleagues,	inGmacy
Esteem	needs:	
Self	esteem,	conﬁdence,	achievements,	respect	of	others
Self-actualiza1on:	
The	opportunity	to	reach	full	potenGal.

So(ware	is	Built	by	Teams
Best	size	for	a	team	is	3	to	8	people
Team	members	may	include:
•

developers	(from	trainee	to	expert)

•

domain	experts

•

graphic	or	interface	designers

•

so(ware	librarians

•

testers

•

etc.

Teams	must	have:
•

•

EnGre	team,	including	support	staﬀ

Remote	meeGngs	on	a	regular	schedule	(e.g.,	conference	calls)
•

Technical	and	administraGve	groups

Clear	division	of	responsibility	between	locaGons	 	

MeeGngs
Mee1ngs	require	leadership	and	a	willingness	to	be	led
•

Time	keeping	--	do	not	be	late;	end	on	Gme	or	earlier

•

Clear	purpose	for	meeGng,	with	agenda
		 e.g.,	progress	reports,	design	review,	budget

•

PreparaGon
	 ->	materials	circulated	in	advance	with	Gme	to	prepare
	 ->	studied	by	all	parGcipants

•

FacilitaGon	during	meeGng
	 ->	opportuniGes	for	all	to	speak
	 ->	summing	up	to	check	agreement

•

Hiring
Produc1vity	is	a	combina1on	of:
•

AnalyGc	ability

•

Verbal	ability	and	communicaGon	skills	

•

EducaGon

•

Adaptability	and	inquisiGveness

Salaries
Any	so9ware	developer	in	the	USA	has	plenty	of	money	to	live	on	
(food,	clothing,	heat,	etc.).
Salaries	are	used	to	saGsfy	the	top	levels	of	Maslow's	Hierarchy:
•

self-actualizaGon

•

esteem

The	absolute	level	of	salary	is	less	important	than	its	relaGve	level	
and	how	it	is	presented:
"The	average	raise	is	4%,	but	you	are	gemng	5%."
"Our	salaries	are	in	the	top	25%	of	internet	companies."

To	Build	and	Maintain	a	Strong	Team
Everybody	has	a	diﬀerent	style.		In	my	experience:	
•

Be	consistent	in	how	you	relate	to	people	

•

Be	open	about	problems	and	how	you	are	addressing	them	

•

Explain	your	decisions		

•

Do	not	have	secrets	

•

Ask	for	advice	and	help	

•

Be	construcGve	in	criGcism	of	people	outside	your	team	

•

Support	and	ahend	social	events

Set	high	standards!

Firmness
Managers	must	be	ﬁrm	when	needed:
•

Assignment	of	tasks	must	be	equitable	and	open;	everybody	will	have	to	
tackle	some	of	the	dreary	tasks.

•

Carrots	are	beher	than	sGcks,	but	poor	performance	must	be	addressed.

•

Nobody	is	indispensable;	nobody	should	be	allowed	to	think	that	they	
are	indispensable.

How	to	be	Led
As	a	junior	member	of	a	team,	what	can	you	do	to	make	it	
produc1ve?
•

Follow	the	team's	style	of	working

•

Understand	the	context	of	your	work

•

Make	pracGcal	suggesGons

•

Ask	for	help	if	you	need	it

•

Accept	less	interesGng	tasks

•

Ahend	social	events

•

Do	good	work

Turning	a	Group	Around
To	turn	a	weak	group	into	a	strong	one	is	the	one	of	the	greatest	
challenges	of	leadership
•

The	art	of	the	possible

•

PromoGon	of	the	best	over	the	old	leaders

•

Using	opportuniGes	to	reorganize

•

ResignaGons	and	terminaGons

•

Respect	people	who	try,	but	refuse	to	accept	problem	areas

Persistent	and	ﬁrm	is	beher	than	brutal	and	abrupt

An	Old	Exam	QuesGon
As	leader	of	a	so3ware	development	team,	you	have	hired	two	new	
members	of	staﬀ.	
(i) The	ﬁrst	has	just	graduated	from	the	Cornell	M.Eng.	program	in	
computer	science,	with	no	work	experience.			
(ii)	The	second	has	ﬁve	years'	experience	in	developing	advanced	
applica#ons,	but	has	never	worked	on	this	type	of	computer.
Some	of	the	development	tasks	are	more	interes#ng	than	others.		Some	
tasks	are	harder	than	others.		Some	are	more		#me	cri#cal	than	others.		
What	approach	would	you	use	in	alloca%ng	the	tasks	to	these	two	new	
members?

Bad	Answers
"The	Cornell	graduate	has	more	experGse	to	tackle	the	harder	
tasks."		
"The	Cornell	graduate	is	used	to	Gme-criGcal	tasks	(course	
assignments)."		
"The	Cornell	graduate	should	be	given	interesGng	work	to	make	
him/her	keen	to	conGnue	with	the	company."		

Bad	Answers
"The	Cornell	graduate	has	more	experGse	to	tackle	the	harder	tasks."			
What	makes	you	so	superior?
"The	Cornell	graduate	is	used	to	Gme-criGcal	tasks	(course	assignments)."			
Sorry,	that's	not	real.
"The	Cornell	graduate	should	be	given	interesGng	work	to	make	him/her	
keen	to	conGnue	with	the	company."			
But	who	cares	if	you	leave?
A	raw	graduate	is	sGll	a	trainee	--	the	most	junior	person	--	much	to	learn	
--	no	experience	of	producGon	quality	development.
But,	hopefully,	with	great	potenGal!

Good	Answers
•

Both	should	have	the	poten1al	to	produce	excellent	so(ware	under	Gght	
Gme	constraints.	

•

Both	new	employees	need	to	learn	the	technical	environment.		Expect	
them	both	to	work	slowly	unGl	they	learn	the	environment.

•

The	junior	(raw	graduate)	needs	mentoring.		The	senior	(experienced	
developer)	might	work	independently	or	lead	a	team.

•

The	junior	should	not	be	put	on	1me-cri1cal	tasks.		The	experienced	
developer	might	be.

•

Both	people	should	be	given	a	mixture	of	more	and	less	interesGng	tasks.		
Discuss	the	allocaGon	with	them.

Outsourcing
When	might	you	contract	with	another	organiza1on	to	carry	out	some	or	all	
parts	of	the	so9ware	development	process?
•

The	other	organizaGon	might	have	experGse	that	your	organizaGon	lacks.	

•

Your	organizaGon	might	not	have	a	large	enough	staﬀ.

•

The	other	organizaGon	might	have	lower	costs	(e.g.,	it	might	operate	in	a	
country,	such	as	India,	where	costs	are	lower).

Example
Most	so(ware	for	the	US	government	is	built	by	contractors.

Outsourcing
Risks
•

The	other	organizaGon	may	not	be	as	skilled	as	you	expect.

•

Staﬀ	have	their	ﬁrst	loyalty	to	their	own	organizaGon.

•

The	other	organizaGon	may	have	use	diﬀerent	terminology	or	have	a	
diﬀerent	culture	(e.g.,	the	organizaGon	may	not	report	problems	to	the	
client).

•

Communica1on	faces	geographic	and	cultural	diﬀerences.

•

Unless	the	task	is	well	understood,	it	may	be	diﬃcult	to	write	a	contract	
that	manages	costs	and	results	(e.g.,	government	contracts	are	notorious	
for	cost	over-runs).

•

If	your	organizaGon	contracts	out	all	interesGng	work,	your	good	staﬀ	will	
leave.

Outsourcing
Example
Company	G	was	the	world's	leader	in	a	specialized	category	of	mathemaGcal	
so(ware.		G	had	successfully	implemented	several	packages	for	various	
manufacturers.
•

A	computer	company	H	contracted	with	G	to	develop	a	package	for	its	new	
computer	system.

•

The	package	for	company	H	was	late,	performed	badly	and	disliked	by	
customers.

•

At	the	same	Gme	G	was	developing	a	package	for	company	I.		This	package	
was	very	successful.

What	went	wrong?	What	can	we	learn?

Outsourcing
When	work	is	out-sourced,	the	client	must	be	vigilant.
•

The	client	must	take	responsibility	for	managing	the	relaGonships	
between	the	project	and	the	client's	organizaGon.

•

The	client	must	have	a	management	and	technical	team	that	can	track	
the	work	being	done,	monitor	quality,	review	changes	to	scope,	etc.

•

The	contract	should	be	explicit	about	expectaGons,	deliverables,	
ownership	of	so(ware,	and	mechanisms	for	payment.

•

The	client	must	be	closely	involved	with	user	tesGng	and	must	control	
the	acceptance	tesGng.

Careers	in	CompuGng

What	will	you	be	doing	one	year	from	now?		Ten	years	from	now?	
•

Careers	outside	compuGng

•

Careers	in	which	you	personally	conGnue	to	do	technical	work

•

Careers	in	which	you	are	responsible	for	the	technical	work	of	others

•

Entrepreneur	–	your	own	company

Entrepreneur
Computer	specialist	have	founded	many	of	the	world’s	great	
companies	(Bill	Gates,	Larry	Page,	Jeﬀ	Bezos,	Mark	Zuckerberg,	...).	
It	is	easier	for	a	computer	specialist	to	obtain	management	experGse	
than	for	a	management	generalist	to	become	a	technical	expert.	
It	is	easier	to	start	young	before	you	have	mortgages,	children,	etc.	
Do	not	be	afraid	of	failure.		It	is	quite	usual	to	fail	at	the	ﬁrst	ahempt,	
but	succeed	later.

Technical	Careers
Super-technical	posi1ons
•

A	very	few	senior	posiGons	which	are	almost	enGrely	technical:	e.g.,	industrial	
research,	universiGes

•

Even	these	have	substanGal	organizaGonal	aspects

Mid-level	technical	posi1ons
•

Numerous	mid-level	professional	posiGons

•

Can	be	state-of-the-art	or	dead-end

Computer	professionals	report	saGsfacGon	with	their	choice	of	careers.

Product	Manager
The	task	of	the	Product	Manager	is	to	ensure	that	the	right	product	is	built	
and	that	the	right	trade-oﬀs	are	made	between	Gmeliness,	funcGonality,	
and	costs.		
This	requires	an	understanding	of:
•

MarkeGng	and	business	consideraGons

•

Technical	opGons	and	design	criteria

•

CommunicaGon	among	groups	with	diﬀerent	experGse		and	prioriGes

A	good	Product	Manager	has	strong	technical	and	management	skills	(e.g.,	a	
computer	scienGst	with	an	MBA).

Careers	that	take	Responsibility	for	the	Technical	Work	
of	Others
A	common	career	progression	is	from	being	a	technical	expert	to	leading	
others	who	do	technical	work
Senior	personnel	must	be	familiar	with	both	the	strategic	organizaGonal	
aspects	and	the	compuGng	aspects	of	the	work,	e.g.,
	 	 Entrepreneur
	 	 Chief	InformaGon	Oﬃcer
	 	 Senior	consultant
•

Requires	good	technical	insight,	not	detailed	technical	experGse

•

Requires	organizaGonal,	markeGng,	personnel,	ﬁnancial	experGse

Product	management	is	a	good	background	for	such	posiGons

Chief	InformaGon	Oﬃcer
The	senior	person	in	an	organiza1on	responsible	for	technology	
•

Usually	a	vice	president.

•

Other	job	Gtles	include	Chief	Technology	Oﬃcer.

•

Background	is	probably	a	combinaGon	of	technology	and	management.

•

May	have	worked	as	a	consultant	(possibly	internal	consultant).	

Requires	strategical	technical	experGse

Careers	outside	CompuGng
A	compu1ng	background	can	be	valuable	in	any	career:	management,	
government,	law,	medicine,	philanthropy,	etc.
EducaGon	in	compuGng	is	an	asset:
•

CompuGng	is	a	vital	part	of	almost	every	organizaGon

•

EducaGon	in	logical	thinking	and	tackling	large	tasks	systemaGcally

EducaGon	in	compuGng	is	a	potenGal	weakness:
•

Not	every	problem	can	be	solved	by	raGonal	thinking	alone

•

Importance	of	skills	with	people,	judgment,	etc.	

Career	Flexibility
Nobody	knows	the	future	of	compu1ng,	but	…
If	you	do	not	learn	conGnuously,	you	are	going	out	of	date	fast
•

Go	to	seminars,	conferences,	training	courses

•

Be	inquisiGve	–	discover	things	for	yourself

Technical	experGse	is	most	valuable	when	combined	with	other	skills
•

Understand	the	organizaGon	that	you	are	part	of,	e.g.,	budgets,	
markeGng.

•

Develop	organizaGonal	skills,	e.g.,	presentaGons,	wriGng,	leadership	

Changing	OrganizaGons
If	you	change	organizaGons,	behave	in	a	professional	manner:
Show	respect	for	the	organiza1on	that	you	leave
•

Respect	trade	secrets	(public	informaGon	is	not	conﬁdenGal)

•

Take	nothing	with	you	except	personal	items

•

Do	not	poach	customers	and	staﬀ

Show	enthusiasm	for	your	new	organiza1on
•

Embrace	their	culture

•

Do	not	criGcize	relaGve	to	old	organizaGon
