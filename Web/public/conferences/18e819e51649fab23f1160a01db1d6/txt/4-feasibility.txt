Feasibility	Study
A	feasibility	study	is	a	study	made	before	committing	to	a	project.
A	feasibility	study	leads	to	a	decision:
•	go	ahead
•	do	not	go	ahead
•	think	again
In	production	projects,	the	feasibility	study	often	leads	to	a	budget	
request.
A	feasibility	study	may	be	in	the	form	of	a	proposal.

Why	are	Feasibility	Studies	Difficult?	
Uncertainty
•	Clients	may	be	unsure	of	the	scope	of	the	project.	
•	Benefits	are	usually	very	hard	to	quantify.
•	Approach	is	usually	ill-defined.		Estimates	of	resources	and	
timetable	are	very	rough.
•	Organizational	changes	may	be	needed.
Therefore,	feasibility	studies	rely	heavily	on	the	judgment	of	
experienced	people.
Mistakes	made	at	the	beginning	of	a	project	are	the	most	difficult	
to	correct.

Why	are	Feasibility	Studies	Difficult?	
Advocacy
•	Advocacy	is	needed	to	build	enthusiasm	for	a	project:	to	
convince	an	organization	to	undertake	an	expensive,	complex	
project	with	many	risks.
•	Enthusiasm	is	good,	but	enthusiasts	usually	emphasize	potential	
benefits	and	downplay	risks.		
People	carrying	out	the	feasibility	study	and	making	the	decision	
often	have	a	vested	interest	in	the	project	going	ahead,	e.g.,	
financial	gain,	career	development.
CS	5150	Feasibility	Study
It	is	possible	that	your	CS	5150	feasibility	study	may	recommend		
not	going	ahead	with	a	project.		

The	Decision	Maker's	Viewpoint
The	feasibility	study	makes	recommendations.		
Senior	member(s)	of	the	client’s	organization	decide	whether	to	begin	a	
major	software	project.	What	information	do	they	needed?
Client:	Who	is	this	project	for?
Scope:		What	are	the	boundaries	of	the	project?
Benefits:		What	are	the	benefits?		Can	they	be	quantified?		If	the	software	
is	a	product,	what	are	the	forecasts	of	likely	sales?
Technical:	Is	the	project	possible?		Is	there	at	least	one	technical	way	to	
carry	out	the	project?	
Resources:	What	are	the	estimates	of	staff,	time,	equipment,	etc.?
Alternatives:		What	are	the	options	if	the	project	is	not	done?

Where	are	the	Risks?		Can	they	be	Minimized?
Technical	risks	
•	There	must	be	an	outline	plan	with	a	rough	timetable	and	staff	allocation.
•	The	plan	must	have	a	very	large	margin	for	contingencies.		(Projects	typically	
require	twice	the	staff	and/or	time	envisaged	in	the	feasibility	plan.)
External
•	Every	system	interacts	with	others.		Are	the	others	committed	to	the	
necessary	efforts	(e.g.,	potential	users	and	customers)?
•	Where	are	the	external	pressures	and	obstacles?

Organizational	Feasibility

A	major	computer	system	makes	demands	on	an	organization:
• Does	the	organization	have	the	management	expertise?
• Does	the	organization	have	the	technical	expertise?		Even	if	the	work	is	
carried	out	by	a	contractor,	the	organization	needs	expertise	to	oversee	the	
work.
• Is	the	organization	committed	to	the	changes	in	personnel,	workflow,	etc.?		
Example
	 Copyright	deposit	system:	clerical	workflow.

Example	1:	U.S.	Government	Agency 
(Decision	before	Feasibility	Study)

Outline	Description
	 A	U.S.	government	agency,	which	manages	huge	numbers	of	
documents	and	other	records,	wishes	to	move	from	a	paper	based	
approach	to	a	system	that	can	manage	digital	documents.

Example	1:	Chronology
• A	computing	center	at	University	S	developed	a	prototype	system	to	
demonstrate	technology.
• Funds	were	approved	by	Congress	to	"procure"	a	major	computer	system.
• An	external	feasibility	study	was	commissioned	to	report	on	the	technical	
approach	to	be	followed	and	the	results	of	the	University	S	prototype	
(technical	feasibility).
Problems		
	 The	decision	to	go	ahead	was	made	and	the	budget	was	approved	before	the	
feasibility	study	was	begun.
	 The	feasibility	study	looked	at	only	the	technical	aspects.

Example	1:	Problems
Organizational:
•	Agency	senior	management	lacked	the	experience	to	lead	a	very	large	
project	that	will	completely	change	the	agency.
•	No	thought	was	given	to	the	workflow	and	job	changes	that	would	
affect	almost	every	member	of	staff.
Preparation:
•	No	preliminary	study	was	made	of	volumes	or	kinds	of	data;	nor	of	the	
complex	policies	for	access	(e.g.,	privacy,	classified	information).
Requirements:	
•	The	requirements	were	complex	and	only	partially	understood.		Major	
changes	were	inevitable	even	after	the	system	went	into	production	
with	real	users.

Example	1:	Dilemma
The	external	feasibility	study	was	paid	for	by	agency	and	restricted	to	technical	
considerations,	but	noted:
•	A	successful	implementation	needed	fundamental	changes	at	the	senior	
management	level.
•	A	phased	approach,	using	iterative	refinement	over	many	years,	might	
possibly	work,	but	only	after	the	organizational	problems	are	addressed.
BUT...
The	agency	did	not	want	to	return	money	to	Congress.
The	agency,	adopted	a	pure	waterfall	model,	put	out	a	Request	for	Proposal	for	
the	requirements,	and	placed	a	major	contract	with	a	software	house.
This	is	how	disasters	are	made.		

Feasibility	Study:	Scope
Scope	expresses	the	boundaries	of	the	system:
• It	will	have		a	list	of	included	functions
• It	will	have	a	list	of	excluded	functions
• It	will	have	a	list	of	dependencies
• It	will	have	a	list	of	current	systems	to	be	replaced
Confusion	over	scope	is	a	common	reason	for	clients	to	be	dissatisfied	
with	a	system.	
"Is	that	all	you	planned	to	do?"		"But	I	assumed	that	you	were	going	to	
do	xyz."		"I	can't	use	the	system	without	abc."

Example	2:		A	Government	Repository 
(Confusion	over	Scope)
•	A	government	organization,	L,	required	a	"repository	system"	to	store	
and	make	accessible	very	large	amounts	of	highly	varied	material	over	
long	periods	of	time.		
•	An	outside	organization,	C,	built	a	repository	system	to	store	and	
manipulate	complex	digital	material.
BUT...	
•	Nobody	built	the	sub-systems	needed	to	organize,	validate,	and	to	load	
material	into	the	repository.
•	L	expected	the	repository	system	to	include	these	sub-systems.		C	
considered	the	sub-systems	separate	from	the	repository	system.
A	good	feasibility	study	would	have	seen	this	confusion.

Feasibility	Study:	Benefits
Why	is	this	project	proposed?		Can	you	quantify	the	benefits?
Organization	benefits
	•			Create	a	marketable	product	
•				Improve	the	efficiency	of	an	organization	(e.g.,	save	staff)
•				Control	a	system	that	is	too	complex	to	control	manually
•				New	or	improved	service	(e.g.,	faster	response	to	customers)
•				Safety	or	security
Professional	benefits	are	not	the	reason	for	doing	a	project

Feasibility	Study:	Technical
A	feasibility	study	needs	to	demonstrate	that	the	proposed	system	is	
technically	feasible.	This	requires:
•			an	outline	of	the	requirements
•			a	possible	system	design	(e.g.,	database,	distributed,	etc.)
•		possible	choices	of	software	to	be	acquired	or	developed
•		estimates	of	numbers	of	users,	data,	transactions,	etc.
These	rough	numbers	are	part	of	the	provisional	plan	that	is	used	to	
estimate	the	staffing,	timetable,	equipment	needs,	etc.
The	technical	approach	actually	followed	may	be	very	different.

Feasibility	Study:	Planning	and	Resources

The	feasibility	study	must	include	an	outline	plan:
•	Estimate	the	staffing	and	equipment	needs,	and	the	preliminary	
timetable
•	Identify	major	milestones	and	decision	points
•	Identify	interactions	with	and	dependences	on	external	systems
•	Provide	a	preliminary	list	of	deliverables	and	delivery	dates
There	is	a	separate	lecture	about	Project	Management.

Feasibility	Study:	Alternatives	and	Risks
A	feasibility	study	should	identify	risks	and	alternatives.	
Risks
• What	can	go	wrong?
• How	will	progress	be	monitored	and	problems	identified	(visibility)?
• What	are	the	fall	back	options?	
Alternatives	
• Continue	with	current	system,	enhance	it,	or	create	new	one?
• Develop	in-house,	or	contract	out?	(How	will	a	contract	be	managed?)
• Phases	of	delivery	and	possible	points	for	revising	plan.

Techniques	for	Feasibility	Studies
The	highest	priority	is	to	ensure	that	the	client	and	
development	team	have	the	same	understanding	of	the	
goals	of	the	system.
For	the	development	team	to	understand	the	goals:
•	Interviews	with	client	and	the	staff	of	the	client’s	
organization
•	Review	of	existing	systems	(including	competitors’)
For	the	client	to	appreciate	the	proposed	system:
•	Demonstration	of	key	features	or	similar	systems
•	Mock-up	of	user	interfaces
•	Walk	through	typical	transactions	or	interactions

Techniques	for	Feasibility	Studies
Outline	budget:
•	n	people	for	m	months	at	$x	per	month
•	equipment,	buildings,	etc.
•	contingency	(at	least	50%	is	needed)
Phases/milestones:
•	specify	deliverables	and	approximate	dates
•	planned	releases

Feasibility	Study:	Decision
Different	organizations	and	senior	managers	have	different	styles	
for	feasibility	studies,	e.g.,	some	decision	makers:
•	Monitor	the	team	and	the	process
•	Rely	on	detailed	reading	of	a	written	report
•	Rely	on	face-to-face	questioning	of	knowledgeable	people	
But	they	must	understand	the	decision.

Feasibility	Report

A	feasibility	study	should	have	a	written	report.	
It	should	be	a	well	written,	well	presented	document.
•			For	a	general	audience:	client,	financial	management,	
					technical	management,	etc.
•				Short	enough	that	everybody	reads	it.
•				Long	enough	that	no	important	topics	are	skipped.
•				Details	can	be	included	in	supporting	documents.
A	report	that	is	not	read	and	understood	is	useless.

CS	5150:	Feasibility	Reports

Two	examples	of	good	CS	5150	feasibility	reports	from	previous	
years	are	on	the	web	site,	with	the	permission	of	the	students.		
They	are	linked	from	the	Reports	section	on	the	Assignments	page.

CS	5150:	Feasibility	Report

Specific	Requirements	for	the	Feasibility	Report
• Outline	plan,	showing	principal	activities	and	milestones	(see	the	
lecture	on	Project	Management).
• Discussion	of	Business	Considerations	(see	Projects	page	on		the	
course	web	site	and	the	lecture	on	Legal	Aspects	of	Software	
Development).
• Risk	analysis.		What	can	go	wrong?		What	is	your	fall	back	plan?

CS	5150:	Challenges
Team:	How	many	hours	per	week?	What	skills	do	people	have?
Time:		Must	be	completed	by	end	of	semester,	including	operational	system,	
documentation,	presentation
Equipment	and	software:		What	special	needs	are	there?
Client:		Will	the	client	be	sufficiently	available	and	able	to	help?
Start-up	time.		Creating	a	team,	scheduling	meetings,	acquiring	software,	
learning	new	systems,	...
Business	considerations.		Licenses,	trade-secrets,	...
Too	ambitious.		Nothing	to	show	at	the		end	of	the	semester...
What	else?

CS	5150:	How	to	Minimize	Risk?

Techniques	for	managing	risk	
•	Several	target	levels	of	functionality:		
	 		 required,	desirable,	optional	phases	
•	Visible	software	process:	intermediate	deliverables	
•	Good	communication	within	the	team,	with	the	client	and	with	the	
Teaching	Assistant(s)	
•	Well	defined	development	process	
Good	processes	lead	to	good	software	
Good	processes	reduce	risk

CS	5150	Feasibility	Studies:	Reports

Appoint	a	team	member	to	read	and	edit	the	entire	report.
Content
•	If	different	authors	write	different	sections	of	the	report	are	they	
consistent?		E.g.,	do	the	scope,	requirements,	and	plan	agree	on	
what	is	to	be	done?
Style
•	Is	the	text	comprehensible?	Does	the	report	use	jargon	that	is	not	
clear	to	the	client?
•	If	possible,	have	a	native	English	speaker	do	the	final	editing.

CS	5150	Feasibility	Studies:	Common	Problems
The	purpose	of	a	feasible	study	is	to	establish	if	a	project	is	feasible,	at	reasonable	
cost,	within	the	planned	period.
The	report	should	conclude	with	recommendations	about	whether	to	proceed,	
but	the	final	decision	is	made	jointly	by	the	client	and	the	development	team.
In	previous	years,	many	reports	have	had	the	following	problems:
•	The	report	is	vague	about	the	scope.		Without	a	clear	definition	of	scope,	it	is	
not	clear	that	the	project	is	feasible.
•	The	plan	does	not	describe	the	activities	in	enough	detail	to	estimate	the	effort	
convincingly.
•	The	projects	is	too	ambitious.		The	report	needs	to	describe	how	will	you	
monitor	the	progress	and	adjust	the	scope	if	necessary.
