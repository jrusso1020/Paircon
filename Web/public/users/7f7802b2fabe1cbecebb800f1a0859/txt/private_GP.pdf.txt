Abstract
Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for finetuning the hyper-parameters of a wide variety of
machine learning models. The success of machine learning has led practitioners in diverse
real-world settings to learn classifiers for practical problems. As machine learning becomes
commonplace, Bayesian optimization becomes
an attractive method for practitioners to automate
the process of classifier hyper-parameter tuning.
A key observation is that the data used for tuning models in these settings is often sensitive.
Certain data such as genetic predisposition, personal email statistics, and car accident history, if
not properly private, may be at risk of being inferred from Bayesian optimization outputs. To
address this, we introduce methods for releasing the best hyper-parameters and classifier accuracy privately. Leveraging the strong theoretical guarantees of differential privacy and known
Bayesian optimization convergence bounds, we
prove that under a GP assumption these private
quantities are often near-optimal. Finally, even if
this assumption is not satisfied, we can use different smoothness guarantees to protect privacy.

In these scenarios data cannot be shared legally, but companies and hospitals may want to share hyper-parameters and
validation accuracies through publications or other means.
However, data-holders must be careful, as even a small
amount of information can compromise privacy.
Which hyper-parameter setting yields the highest accuracy
can reveal sensitive information about individuals in the
validation or training data set, reminiscent of reconstruction attacks described by Dwork & Roth (2013) and Dinur
& Nissim (2003). For example, imagine updated hyperparameters are released right after a prominent public figure is admitted to a hospital. If a hyper-parameter is known
to correlate strongly with a particular disease the patient is
suspected to have, an attacker could make a direct correlation between the hyper-parameter value and the individual.
To prevent these sorts of attacks, we develop a set of algorithms that automatically fine-tune the hyper-parameters
of a machine learning algorithm while provably preserving
differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006b). Our approach
leverages recent results on Bayesian optimization (Snoek
et al., 2012; Hutter et al., 2011; Bergstra & Bengio,
2012; Gardner et al., 2014), training a Gaussian process
(GP) (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006) to accurately predict
and maximize the validation gain of hyper-parameter settings. We show that the GP model in Bayesian optimization
allows us to release noisy final hyper-parameter settings to
protect against aforementioned privacy attacks, while only
sacrificing a tiny, bounded amount of validation gain.

Machine learning is increasingly used in application areas
with sensitive data. For example, hospitals use machine
learning to predict if a patient is likely to be readmitted
soon (Yu et al., 2013), webmail providers classify spam
emails from non-spam (Weinberger et al., 2009), and insurance providers forecast the extent of bodily injury in car
crashes (Chong et al., 2005).

Our privacy guarantees hold for releasing the best hyperparameters and best validation gain. Specifically our contributions are as follows: 1. We derive, to the best of our
knowledge, the first framework for Bayesian optimization
with differential privacy guarantees, with/without oberservation noise, 2. We show that even if our validation gain is
not drawn from a Gaussian process, we can guarantee differential privacy under different smoothness assumptions.

2. Background
In general, our aim will be to protect the privacy of a validation dataset of sensitive records V ⊆ X (where X is
the collection of all possible records) when the results of
Bayesian optimization depends on V.
Bayesian optimization. Our goal is to maximize an unknown function fV : Λ → R that depends on some validation dataset V ⊆ X :
max fV (λ).
λ∈Λ

(1)

It is important to point out that all of our results hold for the
general setting of eq. (1), but throughout the paper, we use
the vocabulary of a common application: that of machine
learning hyper-parameter tuning. In this case fV (λ) is the
gain of a learning algorithm evaluated on validation dataset
V that was trained with hyper-parameters λ ∈ Λ ⊆ Rd .
As evaluating fV is expensive (e.g., each evaluation requires training a learning algorithm), Bayesian optimization gives a procedure for selecting a small number of locations to sample fV : [λ1 , . . . , λT ] = λT ∈ Rd×T . Specifically, given a current sample λt , we observe a validation gain vt such that vt = fV (λt ) + αt , where αt ∼
N (0, σ 2 ) is Gaussian noise with possibly non-zero variance σ 2 . Then, given vt and previously observed values
v1 , . . . , vt−1 , Bayesian optimization updates its belief of
fV and samples a new hyper-parameter λt+1 . Each step of
the optimization proceeds in this way.
To decide which hyper-parameter to sample next, Bayesian
optimization places a prior distribution over fV and updates
it after every (possibly noisy) function observation. One
popular prior distribution
 over functions is the Gaussian
process GP µ(·), k(·, ·) (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006),
parameterized by a mean function µ(·) (we set µ = 0,
w.l.o.g.) and a kernel covariance function k(·, ·). Functions
drawn from a Gaussian process have the property that any
finite set of values of the function are normally distributed.
Additionally, given samples λT = [λ1 , . . . , λT ] and observations vT = [v1 , . . . , vT ], the GP posterior mean and
variance has a closed form:
µT (λ) = k(λ, λT )(KT + σ 2 I)−1 vT
kT (λ, λ0 ) = k(λ, λ0 ) − k(λ, λT )(KT + σ 2 I)−1 k(λT , λ0 )
σT2 (λ) = kT (λ, λ),

(2)

where k(λ, λT ) ∈ R1×T is evaluated element-wise on each
of the T columns of λT , and λ ∈ Λ is any hyper-parameter.
As well, KT = k(λT , λT ) ∈ RT ×T is evaluated on all
hyper-parameter pairs from λT . As more samples are observed, the mean function µT (λ) approaches fV (λ).
One well-known method to select hyper-parameters λ maximizes the upper-confidence bound (UCB) of the posterior

GP model of fV (Auer et al., 2002; Srinivas et al., 2010):
p
(3)
λt+1 , arg max µt (λ) + βt+1 σt (λ),
λ∈Λ

where βT +1 is a parameter that trades off the exploitation of maximizing µt (λ) and the exploration of maximizing σt (λ). Srinivas et al. (2010) proved that given certain assumptions on fV and fixed, non-zero observation
noise (σ 2 > 0), selecting hyper-parameters λ to maximize
eq. (3) is aPno-regret Bayesian optimization procedure:
T
limT →∞ T1 t=1 fV (λ∗ ) − fV (λt ) = 0, where fV (λ∗ ) is
the maximizer of eq. (1). For the no-noise setting, de Freitas et al. (2012) give a UCB-based no-regret algorithm.
Contributions. Alongside maximizing fV , we would
like to guarantee that if fV depends on (sensitive) validation data, we can release information about fV so that the
data V remains private. Specifically, we may wish to release (a) our best guess λ̂ , arg maxt≤T fV (λt ) of the true
(unknown) maximizer λ∗ and (b) our best guess fV (λ̂) of
the true (also unknown) maximum objective fV (λ∗ ). The
primary question this work aims to answer is: how can we
release private versions of λ̂ and fV (λ̂) that are close to
their true values, or better, the values λ∗ and fV (λ∗ )? We
give two answers to these questions. The first will make
a Gaussian process assumption on fV , which we describe
immediately below. The second, described in Section 5,
will utilize Lipschitz and convexity assumptions to guarantee privacy in the event the GP assumption does not hold.
Setting. For our first answer to this question, let us define a Gaussian process over hyper-parameters λ, λ0 ∈ Λ
0
0
and datasets
 V, V ⊆ X as follows: GP 0, k1 (V, V ) ⊗
0
k2 (λ, λ ) . A prior of this form is known as a multi-task
Gaussian process (Bonilla et al., 2008). Many choices for
k1 and k2 are possible. The function k1 (V, V 0 ) defines a
set kernel (e.g., a function of the number of records that
differ between V and V 0 ). For k2 , we focus on either the
squared exponential: k2 (λ, λ0 ) = exp −kλ − λ0 k22 /(2`2 )
or
(e.g., for ν√ = 5/2, k2 (λ, λ0 ) = (1 +
√ Matérn kernels:
2
2
5r/` + (5r )/(3` )) exp(− 5r/`), for r = kλ − λ0 k2 ),
for a fixed `, as they have known bounds on the maximum
information gain (Srinivas et al., 2010). Note that as defined, the kernel k2 is normalized (i.e., k2 (λ, λ) = 1).
Assumption 1. We have a problem of type (1), where
all possible dataset functions [f1 , . . ., f2|X | ] are GP distributed GP 0, k1 (V, V 0 ) ⊗ k2 (λ, λ0 ) for known kernels
k1 , k2 , for all V, V 0 ⊆ X and λ, λ0 ∈ Λ, where |Λ| < ∞.
Similar Gaussian process assumptions have been made in
previous work (Srinivas et al., 2010). For a result in the nonoise observation setting, we will make use of the assumptions of de Freitas et al. (2012) for our privacy guarantees,
as described in Section 4.

Differentially Private Bayesian Optimization

2.1. Differential Privacy
One of the most widely accepted frameworks for private
data release is differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006b),
which has been shown to be robust to a variety of privacy attacks (Sweeney, 1997; Dinur & Nissim, 2003; Ganta
et al., 2008; Narayanan & Shmatikov, 2008). Given an algorithm A that outputs a value λ when run on dataset V,
the goal of differential privacy is to ‘hide’ the effect of a
small change in V on the output of A. Equivalently, an attacker should not be able to tell if a single private record
was changed in V just by looking at the output of A. If two
datasets V, V 0 differ in the value of a single individual, we
will refer to them as neighboring datasets. Note that any
non-trivial algorithm (i.e., an algorithm A that outputs different values on V and V 0 for some pair V, V 0 ⊆ X ) must
include some amount of randomness to guarantee such a
change in V is ‘unobservable’ in the output λ of A (Dwork
& Roth, 2013). The level of privacy we wish to guarantee decides the amount of randomness we need to add to λ
(better privacy requires increased randomness). Formally,
the definition of differential privacy is stated below.
Definition 1. A randomized algorithm A is (, δ)differentially private for , δ ≥ 0 if for all λ ∈ Range(A)
and for all neighboring datasets V, V 0 (i.e., such that V and
V 0 differ in the value of one record) we have that




Pr A(V) = λ ≤ e Pr A(V 0 ) = λ + δ.
(4)
The parameters , δ guarantee how private A is; the smaller,
the more private. The maximum privacy is  = δ = 0 in
which case eq. (4) holds with equality. This can be seen by
the fact that V and V 0 can be swapped in the definition, and
thus the inequality holds in both directions. If δ = 0, we
say the algorithm is simply -differentially private. For a
survey on differential privacy we refer the interested reader
to Dwork & Roth (2013).
There are two popular methods for making an algorithm differentially private: (a) the Laplace mechanism (Dwork
et al., 2006b), in which we add random noise to λ and (b)
the exponential mechanism (McSherry & Talwar, 2007),
which draws a random output λ̃ such that λ̃ ≈ λ. For
each mechanism we must define an intermediate quantity called the global sensitivity describing how much A
changes when V changes.
Definition 2. (Laplace mechanism) The global sensitivity
of an algorithm A over all neighboring datasets V, V 0 (i.e.,
V, V 0 differ by the value of one record) is
0

∆A , max
kA(V) − A(V )k1 .
0

The Laplace mechanism hides the output of A by perturbing its output with some amount of random noise.
Definition 3. Given a dataset V and an algorithm A, the
Laplace mechanism returns A(V) + ω, where ω is a noise
variable drawn from Lap(∆A /), the Laplace distribution
with scale parameter ∆A / (and location parameter 0).
The exponential mechanism draws a slightly different λ̃
that is ‘close’ to λ, the output of A.
Definition 4. Given a dataset V and an algorithm
A(V) = arg maxλ∈Λ q(V, λ), the exponential mechanism returns λ̃, whereλ̃ is drawn from the distribution
1
Z exp q(V, λ)/(2∆q ) , and Z is a normalizing constant.
Given Λ, a possible set of hyper-parameters, we derive
methods for privately releasing the best hyper-parameters
and the best function values fV , approximately solving
eq. (1). We first address the setting with observation noise
(σ 2 > 0) in eq. (2) and then describe small modifications
for the no-noise setting. For each setting we use the UCB
sampling technique in eq. (3) to derive our private results.

3. With observation noise
In general cases of Bayesian optimization, observation
noise occurs in a variety of real-world modeling settings
such as sensor measurements (Krause et al., 2008). In
hyper-parameter tuning, noise in the validation gain may
be as a result of noisy validation or training features.

Differentially Private Bayesian Optimization

3.1. Private near-maximum hyper-parameters
In this section we guarantee that releasing λ̃ in Algorithm
1 is private (Theorem 1) and has high utility (Theorem 2).
Our proof strategy is as follows: we will first demonstrate
the global sensitivity of µT (λ) with probability at least 1−
δ. Then we will show that releasing λ̃ via the exponential
mechanism is (, δ)-differentially private. Finally, we show
that µT (λ̃) is close to maxλ∈Λ µT (λ).
Global sensitivity. As a first step we bound the global
sensitivity of µT (λ) as follows:
Theorem 1. Given Assumption 1, for any two neighboring
datasets V, V 0 and for all λ ∈ Λ with probability at least
1 − δ there is an upper bound on the global sensitivity (in
the exponential mechanism sense) of µT :

tail probability bounds) for selected hyperparameters αi ∈
{α1 , . . . , αT } we have that µT (αi ) ≈ f (λi ). Therefore,
it is reasonable to select λ = arg maxλ∈Λ µT (λ), to optimize (1). McSherry & Talwar (2007) show that exponential
mechanism (line 12) selects a noisy maximum as follows.
Theorem 2. (McSherry & Talwar, 2007) The exponential
mechanism selects λ̃ that has value µT (λ̃) that is close to
the maximum maxλ∈Λ µT (λ),
maxλ∈Λ µT (λ) − µT (λ̃) ≤

and c defined as in Algorithm 1).
Notice that as T increases, so does ∆ in the above inequality, as the distribution in line 12 becomes more uniform.
However, because ∆ increases
p much more slowly than T
(i.e. ∆ is asymptotically O( log(T +1)2 )), T should be
selected as large as possible to achieve small average regret.
3.2. Private near-maximum validation gain

Proof. Note that, by applying the triangle inequality twice,
for all λ ∈ Λ,
|µ0T (λ) − µT (λ)| ≤ |µ0T (λ) − f 0 (λ)| + |f 0 (λ) − µT (λ)|
≤ |µ0T (λ) − f 0 (λ)| + |f 0 (λ) − f (λ)| + |f (λ) − µT (λ)|.
We can now bound each one of the terms in the summation
on the right hand side (RHS) with probability at least 3δ .
According to Srinivas
p et al. (2010), Lemma 5.1, we obtain
|µ0T (λ) − f 0 (λ)| ≤ βT +1 σT0 (λ). The same can be applied
k(λ, λ) = 1,
to |f (λ) − µT (λ)|. As σT0 (λ) ≤ 1, because
p
we can upper bound both terms by 2 βT +1 . In order to
bound the remaining (middle) term on the RHS recall that

We remark that all of the quantities in Theorem 1 are either
given or selected by the modeler (e.g, δ, T ). Given this
upper bound we can apply the exponential mechanism to
release λ̃ privately, as per Definition 1:

ṽ in Algorithm 1 is private (Theorem 3) and that the noise
we add to ensure privacy is bounded with high probability (Theorem 4). As in the previous section our approach
will be to first derive the global sensitivity of the maximum v found by Algorithm 1. Then we show releasing ṽ
is (, δ)-differentially private via the Laplace mechanism.
Surprisingly, we can also show that ṽ is close to f (λ∗ ).
Global sensitivity. We bound the global sensitivity of the
maximum v found with Bayesian optimization and UCB:

This implies | maxt≤T f 0 (λt ) − maxt≤T f (λt )| ≤ TΩ + c.
That is, the global sensitivity of maxt≤T f (λt ) is bounded.

Therefore if we set Z = α̂
we have γ = 2 log(3/δ). This
pσ
implies that |2α̂| ≤ σ 8 log(3/δ) = q with probability at

(2010) and the bound on |f (λ) − f 0 (λ)| hold together with

follows directly.

This implies that f (λ∗ ) − ṽ ≥ −αtv,max − TΩ − ab. Thus

Finally, because αtf,max and αtv,max could be arbitrarily
large we give a high probability upper bound on these
quantities. Let α̂ , max{αtf,max , αtv,max }. Again recall
that for Z ∼ N (0, 1), we have the tail probability bound

set Z = α̂
arrive at γ = σ 2 log(1/δ). This entails

p
that 2α̂ ≤ σ 8 log(1/δ). Therefore, our proposed bound
in Theorem 4 holds.

The right side of Theorem 4 becomes smaller as T increases, so T should be set as large as possible. We note
that, because releasing either λ̃ or ṽ is (, δ)-differentially
private, by Corollaries 1 and 2, releasing both private quantities in Algorithm 1 guarantees (2, 2δ)-differential privacy for validation dataset V. This is due to the composition properties of (, δ)-differential privacy (Dwork et al.,
2006a) (in fact stronger composition results can be demonstrated, (Dwork & Roth, 2013)).

Differentially Private Bayesian Optimization

4. Without observation noise
In hyper-parameter tuning it may be reasonable to assume
that we can observe function evaluations exactly: vV,t =
fV (λt ). First note that we can use the same algorithm to
report the maximum λ in the no-noise setting. Indeed,
Theorems 1 and 2 still hold. However, we cannot readily report a private maximum f as the information gain
γT in Theorems 3 and 4 approaches infinity as σ 2 → 0.
Therefore, we extend results from the previous section to
the exact observation case via the regret bounds of de Freitas et al. (2012). In this setting, the authors show that they
can achieve exponentially-decreasing regret for each sample: f (λ∗ ) − f (λt ) < O(e−t/ log(t) ). Therefore our strategy will be to select the last sample and add enough noise to
cover a change in a validation record. Algorithm 2 demonstrates this strategy for privatizing the maximum f .

4.1. Private near-maximum validation gain
We demonstrate that releasing f˜ in Algorithm 2 is private
(Corollary 3) and that a small amount of noise is added
to make f˜ private (Theorem 6). To do so, we derive the
global sensitivity of fV (λT ) in Algorithm 2 independent
of the maximum information gain γT via de Freitas et al.
(2012). Then we prove releasing f˜ is (, δ)-differentially
private and that f˜ is close to the optimal f (λ∗ ).
Global sensitivity. The following Theorem gives a
bound on the global sensitivity of the maximum f .
Theorem 5. Given Assumption 1 and the assumptions
in Theorem 2 of de Freitas et al. (2012), for neighboring datasets V, V 0 we have the following global sensitivity
bound (in the Laplace mechanism sense),
−

w.p. at least 1 − δ for c = 2 1−k(V, V 0 ) log(2|Λ|/δ),
given constants A and τ in de Freitas et al. (2012).
We leave the proof to the supplementary material.
Given this sensitivity, we may apply the Laplace mechanism to release f˜.

Corollary 3. Let A(V) denote Algorithm 2 run on dataset
V. Given Assumption 1 and that f satisfies the assumptions
of de Freitas et al. (2012), f˜ is (, δ)-differentially private,
with respect to any neighboring dataset V 0 , i.e.,




Pr A(V) = f˜ ≤ e Pr A(V 0 ) = f˜ + δ.
Even though we must add noise to the maximum f we show
that f˜ is still close to the optimal f (λ∗ ).
Theorem 6. Given the assumptions of Corollary 3, we
have the utility guarantee for Algorithm 2:

|f˜ − f (λ∗ )| ≤ Ω + a Ω + c
w.p. at least 1−(δ + e−a ) for Ω = Ae

.

We prove Corollary 3 and Theorem 6 in the supplementary
material. As in the noisy setting, selecting T as large as
possible is the best strategy, as this reduces the right side of
Theorem 6 (less Laplacian noise is required). We have thus
shown that in noisy and noise-free settings it is possible to
release private, high-quality hyper-parameter settings λ̃ as
well as private, near-optimal function evaluations ṽ, f˜.

5. Without the GP assumption
Even if our our true validation score f is not drawn from
a Gaussian process (Assumption 1), we can still guarantee
differential privacy for releasing its value after Bayesian
optimization f BO = maxt≤T f (λt ). In this section we
describe a different functional assumption on f that also
yields differentially private Bayesian optimization for the
case of machine learning hyper-parameter tuning.
Assume we have a (nonsensitive) training set T =
{(xi , yi )}ni=1 , which, given a hyperparameter λ produces
a model w(λ) from the following optimization,
Oλ (w)

z

{

wλ = arg min kwk22 +
`(w, xi , yi ),

(9)

The function ` is a training loss function (e.g., logistic
loss, hinge loss). Given a (sensitive) validation set V =
{(xi , y i )}m
i=1 ⊆ X we would like to use Bayesian optimization to maximize a validation score fV .
Assumption 2. Our true validation score fV is
m

fV (wλ ) = −

1 X
g(wλ , xi , y i ),
m i=1

where g(·) is a validation loss function that is L-Lipschitz
in wλ (e.g., ramp loss, normalized sigmoid (Huang et al.,
2014)). Additionally, the training model wλ is the minimizer of eq. (9) for a training loss `(·) that is 1-Lipschitz in
wλ and convex (e.g., logistic loss, hinge loss).

Differentially Private Bayesian Optimization

Algorithm 3 describes a procedure for privately releasing
the best validation accuracy f BO given Assumption 2. Different from previous algorithms, we may run Bayesian optimization in Algorithm 3 with any acquisition function
(e.g., expected improvement (Mockus et al., 1978), UCB)
and privacy is still guaranteed.

Further, define the minimizers wλ = arg minw Oλ (w) and
wλ0 = arg minw [Oλ (w) + h(w)]. This implies that
∇Oλ (wλ ) = ∇Oλ (wλ0 ) + ∇h(wλ0 ) = 0.

(11)

Given that Oλ is λ-strongly convex (Shalev-Shwartz,
2007), and by the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality,

Similar to Algorithms 1 and 2 we use the Laplace mechanism to mask the possible change in validation accuracy
when a single record is changed in V. Different from the related work of Chaudhuri & Vinterbo (2013) changing V to
neighboring dataset V 0 may also lead to Bayesian optimization searching different hyper-parameters, ΛV,T vs. ΛV 0 ,T .
Therefore, we must bound the total global sensitivity of f
with respect to V and λ,
Definition 5. The total global sensitivity of f over all
neighboring datasets V, V 0 is
V,V ⊆X
λ,λ0 ∈Λ

In the following theorem we demonstrate that we can
bound the change in f for arbitrary λ < λ0 (w.l.o.g.).
Theorem 7. Given Assumption 2, for neighboring V, V 0
and arbitrary λ < λ0 we have that,
 ∗
0
|fV (wλ )−fV 0 (wλ0 )| ≤ (λλ−λ)L
+ min gm , mλLmin
0λ
where L is the Lipschitz constant of f , m is the size of V,
and g ∗ = max(x,y)∈X ,w∈Rp g(w, x, y).
Proof. Applying the triangle inequality yields
|fV (wλ ) − fV 0 (wλ0 )| ≤ |fV (wλ ) − fV (wλ0 )|
+ |fV (wλ0 ) − fV 0 (wλ0 )|.
This second term is bounded by Chaudhuri & Vinterbo
(2013) in the proof of Theorem 4. The only difference is,
as we are not adding random noise to wλ0 we have that
|fV (wλ0 ) − fV 0 (wλ0 )| ≤ min{g ∗ /m, L/(mλmin ) }.
To bound the first term, let Oλ (w) be the value of the objective in eq. (9) for a particular λ. Note that Oλ (w) and
Oλ0 (w) are λ and λ0 -strongly convex. Define
λ0 −λ
2
2 kwk2 .

Substituting this value of wλ0 into eq. (12) and noting that
we can pull the positive constant term (λ0 − λ)/2 out of the
norm and drop the negative sign in the norm gives us

The last equality follows from the fact that the loss ` is

Thus, along with eq. (12), we have

∆f , max
|fV (wλ ) − fV 0 (wλ0 )|.

h(w) = Oλ0 (w) − Oλ (w) =

Now as wλ0 is the minimizer of Oλ0 we have,

(10)

kwλ −wλ0 k2 ≤ λ1 k∇h(wλ0 )k2 ≤

Finally, as f is L-Lipschitz in w,
0

−λ
|fV (wλ ) − fV (wλ0 )| ≤ Lkwλ − wλ0 k2 ≤ L λλλ

Combining the result of Chaudhuri & Vinterbo (2013) with
the above expression completes the proof.

One should set T as large as possible as Bayesian optimization may only possibly find better parameter settings when
T is increased, and the noise added is independent of T .

6. Related work
There has been much work towards differentially private convex optimization (Chaudhuri et al., 2011; Kifer
et al., 2012; Duchi et al., 2013; Song et al., 2013; Jain &
Thakurta, 2014; Bassily et al., 2014). The work of Bassily et al. (2014) established upper and lower bounds for
the excess empirical risk of  and (, δ)-differentially private algorithms for many settings including convex and
strongly convex risk functions that may or may not be
smooth. There is also related work towards private highdimensional regression, where the dimensions outnumber the number of instances (Kifer et al., 2012; Smith &
Thakurta, 2013a). In such cases the Hessian becomes singular and so the loss is nonconvex. However, it is possible
to use the restricted strong convexity of the loss in the regression case to guarantee privacy.
Differential privacy has been shown to be achievable in
online and interactive kernel learning settings (Jain et al.,
2012; Smith & Thakurta, 2013b; Jain & Thakurta, 2013;
Mishra & Thakurta, 2014). In general, non-private online
algorithms are closest in spirit to the methods of Bayesian
optimization. However, all of the previous work in differentially private online learning represents a dataset as
a sequence of bandit arm pulls (the equivalent notion in
Bayesian optimization is function evaluations f (λt )). Instead, we consider functions in which changing a single
dataset entry possibly affects all future function evaluations. Closest to our work is that of Chaudhuri & Vinterbo (2013), who show that given a fixed set of hyperparameters which are always evaluated for any validation
set, they can return a private version of the index of the
best hyper-parameter, as well as a private model trained
with that hyper-parameter. In one sense, their setting is
more difficult as they guarantee privacy for the training and
validation sets (we assume the training set is fixed). On the
other hand, our selection strategy is more general in that,
if the validation set changes, Bayesian optimization could
search completely different hyper-parameters.
Bayesian optimization, largely due to its principled han-

dling of the exploration/exploitation trade-off of global,
black-box function optimization, is quickly becoming
the global optimization paradigm of choice. Alongside
promising empirical results there is a wealth of recent work
on convergence guarantees for Bayesian optimization, similar to those used in this work (Srinivas et al., 2010; de Freitas et al., 2012). Vazquez & Bect (2010) and Bull (2011)
give regret bounds for optimization with the expected improvement acquisition function. BayesGap (Hoffman et al.,
2014) gives a convergence guarantee for Bayesian optimization with budget constraints. Bayesian optimization
has also been extended to multi-task optimization (Bardenet et al., 2013; Swersky et al., 2013), the parallel experiment setting (Azimi et al., 2012; Snoek et al., 2012),
and to constrained optimization (Gardner et al., 2014).

7. Conclusion
We have introduced methods for privately releasing the
best hyper-parameters and validation accuracies in the case
of exact and noisy observations. Our work makes use
of the differential privacy framework, which has become
commonplace in private machine learning (Dwork & Roth,
2013). We believe we are the first to demonstrate differentially private quantities in the setting of global optimization
of expensive (possibly nonconvex) functions, through the
lens of Bayesian optimization.
One key future direction is to design techniques to release
each sampled hyper-parameter and validation accuracy privately (during the run of Bayesian optimization). This
requires analyzing how the maximum upper-confidence
bound changes as the validation dataset changes. Another
interesting direction is extending our guarantees in Sections
3 and 4 to other acquisition functions.
For the case of machine learning hyper-parameter tuning
our results are designed to guarantee privacy of the validation set only (it is equivalent to guarantee that the training
set is never allowed to change). To simultaneously protect
the privacy of the training set it may be possible to use techniques similar to the training stability results of Chaudhuri
& Vinterbo (2013). Training stability could be guaranteed,
for example, by assuming an additional training set kernel
that bounds the effect of altering the training set on f . We
leave developing these guarantees for future work.
